# React Native Pomodoro App

## About

This project is a Pomodoro app developed using React Native and Expo. Its primary purpose is to serve as a learning and skill improvement project for React Native with Expo. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app allows you to practice and enhance your React Native skills while building a functional Pomodoro timer.
